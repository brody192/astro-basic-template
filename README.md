## ‚ùì What was changed from the default AstroWind example?

#### Useing the Node adapter with the `server` output mode is an easy way to get your Astro site running on Railway effciently.

1. Install the Node adadpter

    `npm i @astrojs/node`

2. Import the Node adapter

    Under the `defineConfig` import line paste the import for the Node adapter.

    `import node from '@astrojs/node';`

3. Set the output to `server` and the host to `0.0.0.0`

    Paste this into the `astro.config.ts` file with the `defineConfig` object -

    ```javascript
    output: 'server',
    adapter: node({
      mode: 'standalone',
    }),

    server: {
      host: '0.0.0.0'
    },
    ```

4. Update the start script

    In the `package.json` set the `start` script to -

    `node ./dist/server/entry.mjs`

    This will start the server in production mode.


Railway will automatically use the `build` and `start` scripts from the package.json.

Thats all the changes needed to deploy an Astro app on Railway!
